üöÄ Features
Automated Web Crawling: Utilizes Tavily to fetch and parse content from specified URLs.

Multilingual Translation: Translates non-English content to English using the Deep Translator API.

Structured Data Ingestion: Ingests and organizes data into LangGraph for efficient retrieval.

Intelligent Summarization: Employs LangChain to generate concise summaries and answers from the ingested data.

Modular Agent Design: Features distinct agents for research, translation, ingestion, retrieval, and drafting, promoting scalability and maintainability.‚Äã
