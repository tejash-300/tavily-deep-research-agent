Description
This project orchestrates two agents:

ResearchAgent: crawls seed URLs or performs Tavily searches to collect raw web content.

DraftingAgent: uses LangChain’s RetrievalQA to generate answers with source citations.

A TranslationAgent optionally normalizes non-English text, while GraphIngestorWithCred and GraphRetriever leverage LangGraph and Chroma for metadata, embeddings, and retrieval.

Features
Tavily Extraction & Search for robust web crawling

Multilingual Chunking & Translation of web snippets 
FreeCodeCamp

Credibility Scoring (WHOIS age, Alexa rank, sentiment, fake-news detection)

LangGraph Storage of metadata & embeddings

Chroma Vector Retrieval fallback for offline operation

Answer Drafting with OpenAI’s GPT via LangChain RetrievalQA

Resilient Pipeline: ingestion failures are non-fatal, fallback to local indexing

Model Architecture
Below is a Mermaid flowchart illustrating the end-to-end data flow. Mermaid is a Markdown-inspired tool supported by GitHub for creating diagrams inline.
